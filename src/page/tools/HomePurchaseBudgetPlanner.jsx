                    <p>Determine how much money you have to put towards a down payment on a house. A few notes to remember here:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This should not come from your emergency fund, retirement, etc.</li>
                        <li>There will be closing costs, do not put all spare savings towards the down payment</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p className="fw-bold mt-4">Example</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Down Payment: $45,000</p>

                    <h3 id="Step2" className="fs-4 mb-4">Step 2: Determine Mortgage Paying Potential</h3>
                    <p>Examine your budget to determine how much you could spend on a mortgage payment. This includes what you are currently paying for housing as well as spare money in your budget. Make sure to keep this number below recommended thresholds for how much to spend on housing.</p>

                    <p className="fw-bold mt-4">Example</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Monthly Payment: $2,000</p>

                    <h3 id="Step3" className="fs-4 mb-4">Step 3: Research Mortgage Rates</h3>
                    <p>Investigate online what rates are being charged on mortgages. It may be useful to know your credit score in order to determine what rate you may receive.</p>

                    <p className="fw-bold mt-4">Example</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Interest Rate: 7%</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3 className="fs-4 mb-4">Step 4: Choose Term Length</h3>
                    <p>Choose how long your mortgage will last. 30 is most common with 15 as another common choice.</p>

                    <p className="fw-bold mt-4">Example</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Term Length: 30 years</p>

                    <p className="fw-bold mt-4">Example</p>

                        <p>Purchase Budget: $250,000</p>

                    <h3 className="fs-4 mb-4">Step 6: Research the Market</h3>

                    <p>Research houses in your price range and in the area you wish to live. Adjust your budget up or down based on how well the houses meet your expectations. </p>
                    <p><em>Note: To adjust your budget up, you need to increase your down payment, increase your monthly payment, or decrease your interest rate, all which require time and planning to achieve.</em></p>
